# PlaylistManager

PlaylistManager is a tool developed in Go that seamlessly integrates Spotify playlists with your local music library. It allows you to create custom playlists effortlessly by matching tracks from your Spotify playlists with those in your local music directory. 

## Description

This project aims to simplify the process of managing playlists by automating the task of creating custom playlists that combine tracks from both Spotify and your local music library. It utilizes the Spotify API to extract track information from your playlists and scans your local music folder to identify compatible music files. The tool then matches tracks from your Spotify playlists with those in your local library, ensuring a seamless blend of your favorite tunes. Finally, it creates a new playlist file (M3U format) containing the matched tracks, ready for you to enjoy across your devices.

## Future Development

In the future, I plan to expand this project into a full-fledged REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment, offering more dynamic functionality. Currently, it's still in development, and I'm using it to learn Go programming language, adding new features, and improving its capabilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with PlaylistManager, make sure you have Go installed on your machine, access to the Spotify API, and local music files in a directory. Clone the repository, build the project, and run the executable.
