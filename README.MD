# PlaylistManager

PlaylistManager is a tool that seamlessly integrates Spotify playlists with your local music library, allowing you to create custom playlists effortlessly.

## Features

- **Track Extraction**: Utilizes the Spotify API to extract track information from your Spotify playlists.
- **Local Music Library**: Scans your local music folder, identifying compatible music files.
- **Matching Tracks**: Matches tracks from your Spotify playlist with those in your local library, ensuring a seamless blend of your favorite tunes.
- **Playlist Creation**: Creates a new playlist file (M3U format) containing the matched tracks, ready for you to enjoy across your devices.

## Future Development

In the future, I envision expanding this tool into a full-fledged REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment. Currently, it's still in development, and I'm using it to learn Go programming language, adding new features, and improving its capabilities.
